# Animated 3d boxes

This project switches between gifs and uses a creative transition animation. 

For the CSS, I got to use the properties ***transform*** and ***transition***, as well as play around with the pseudo selectors ***before*** and ***after***.

For the JavaScript, I used a couple of ***event listeners*** for the buttons and used a couple of the ***Math*** object's methods. 

A big issue I had was calculating the image display when the boxes broke apart. Using the background-position property in JavaScript was a headache, but the final outcome made the struggle worth it.
