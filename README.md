# Animated 3d boxes

This project switches between gifs and uses a creative transition animation. 

For the CSS I got to use the properties ***transform*** and ***transition***, as well as play around with the pusedo selectors ***before*** and ***after***.

For the JavaScript I used a couple of ***event listeners*** for the buttons and use a couple of the ***Math*** object's methods. 

A big issue I had was how to calulate the display of the image when the boxes broke apart. Using the background-position property in JavaScript was a headache, but the final outcome made the stuggle worth it. 

> **_Note:_** It is important to mention that I did not create the gifs/images that I used on this project. I found them on instagram and tumblr. Here are the links to the owner/creater of the gifs:

For my other project: I would like to add a scroll over effect, where the mouse goes over and "pushes" the boxes in.
